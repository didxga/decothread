Building the source:

	Requirements:
		- Apache Ant >= 1.6
		- Apache Ivy 2.0.0
		- Java >= 1.5 (tested on the Sun JDK)

	If you have Ant and Ivy properly configured on your machine, you can build
	the project by simply running the following.

	$ ant compile

	Currently, there is no packaging target, but that will be fixed shortly.

	Troubleshooting the build:

		Q: I get errors about Ant not knowing about the <ivy:blah /> tasks.
		What do I do?
		A: The Ivy jar file isn't in Ant's lib directory. You can fix this
		quickly by either copying or symlinking ivy-2.0.0.jar in Ant's lib
		directory (which is probably something like /usr/share/ant/lib).
		Alternatively, if you can't or simply do not want to modify your Ant
		installation, you can run Ant with the "-lib /path/to/ivy/directory/"
		argument.

		# Tell Ant where to find ivy-2.0.0.jar:
		$ ant -lib /usr/share/javalibs/

		Q: The code doesn't compile! Help!
		A: Let me know and I'll do what I can, but the state of the code is
		what it is and is provided as is (until things get going at which point
		I *may* decide to provide whatever level of support I feel like
		providing - I have a day job).

		Q: Can you add / remove / change feature ...
		A: Let's talk about it. Maybe, maybe not. Let me know.

Feedback:

	I am very interested in any and all feedback, positive or otherwise
	(although mildly constructive is always nice). Email me or come comment on
	my (ugh) blog. (See above.)
